## System Architecture

### Core Architectural Decisions
- **Unified Role System:** Single `UserRole` class in `core/role_constants.py` imported by all modules, supporting RBAC (ROOT/ADMIN, LEADER, MANAGER, GUEST).
- **Centralized FSM States:** All FSM states defined in `core/states.py` for consistent state management.
- **Modular Design:** Clear separation of concerns with dedicated folders for configuration, core services, database, handlers, keyboards, middlewares, and utilities.
- **Asynchronous Operations:** Utilizes `aiogram 3.3` and `asyncpg` with an optimized connection pool for high performance.
- **Background Task Processing:** `core/background_tasks.py` handles non-blocking and heavy operations like OSINT.
- **Security-First Approach:** Implements SHADOW keys, AES-256-CBC encryption, Telegram ID binding, and comprehensive audit logging. Includes rate limiting, anti-fraud, and session validation.
- **Reusable UI Components:** Paginator, ProgressBar, and MenuBuilder in `core/ui_components.py` for consistent user experience.
- **AI Integration:** Seamless integration with OpenAI-compatible models (e.g., GPT-5) via Replit AI for various AI-powered features.
- **Advanced Campaign Management:** Features a worker pool with async queues, weighted round-robin bot selection, adaptive delay calculation, and A/B testing.
- **Enhanced OSINT Engine:** Deep analysis capabilities including network graph building, threat assessment, pattern detection (phones, crypto, coordinates, emails), and evidence storage.
- **Real-time Monitoring:** Telethon-based event listener for real-time threat detection, pattern matching, and auto-actions.
- **Dynamic Alert Thresholds:** Configurable rules engine for various events with actions like logging, alerting, and escalation.
- **Comprehensive Funnel System:** Full CRUD for funnels, integration with mailing templates, scheduling, OSINT analysis, and monitoring with trigger-based transitions.
- **Advanced Tools:** Includes AI Pattern Detection, Spam Analyzer, Drip Campaign Manager, Behavior Profiler, Enhanced Report Generator, and Keyword Analyzer.

### UI/UX Standards
- Ukrainian language throughout the interface.
- Consistent use of dividers (e.g., `═══════════════════════`).
- Standardized button layouts (1/2/3 per row).
- Rich HTML formatting (bold, italic, code) for messages.
- Tree-like list structures (e.g., `├ └`).

## External Dependencies
